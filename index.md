# About this site
This site will be used as way to share various Azure related topics, hands-on labs, how-to guides.  

Please checkout my [Azure Chaos Studio - Labs site](https://rickcau.github.io/Chaos-Lab) if you want to learn Azure Chaos Studio or any of the [Repositories](https://github.com/Rickcau) I am playing around with.

**Disclaimer:** This website is under constant modification.  If you find something isn't working properly, I could be making some changes on the back-end.  At the time this site was published 4/8/2023, Chaos Studio is in *preview* so things could change.
